# About

This repository holds a number of gml-based tools that complement GameMaker's existing code base. Tools come in their own classes and will specify any dependencies they may require but otherwise are generally stand-alone. Syncing this entire repository will give you these classes as well as a GameMaker project with demos showing how to use each tool.
