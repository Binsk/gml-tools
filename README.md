# About

This repository holds a number of gml-based tools that complement GameMaker's existing code base. Tools come in their own classes and will specify any dependencies they may require but otherwise are generally stand-alone. Syncing this entire repository will give you these classes as well as a GameMaker project with demos showing how to use each tool.

**Compatability:** These scripts are currently only guaranteed to work with the desktop platform using the GameMaker runner.

# Tools

## Signaler

**About:** Signalers provide a way to attach any number of methods to a text label which will be executed in order simply by calling the label. Each method can be given arguments both when attached and when called thus providing a very effective way to execute actions in a more passive manner.

**Dependencies:** None

**Class:** [Link](scripts/scr_signals/scr_signals.gml)
